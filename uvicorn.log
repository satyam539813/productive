DEBUG: AI response: <s> [B_INST] Here's a concise AI summary with suggestions for improvement:

**Summary:**
This week, you experienced 11 days of low productivity, with no high or medium productivity days. This suggests a consistent struggle with focus, motivation, or task management.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
1. **Break Tasks into Smaller Steps:** Large tasks can feel overwhelming. Break them into smaller, manageable steps to build momentum.
2. **Prioritize Tasks:** Use a system like the Eisenhower Matrix to focus on whatÆs urgent and important.
3. **Set Micro-Goals:** Aim for small, achievable goals each day to build confidence and momentum.
4. **Eliminate Distractions:** Identify and minimize distractions (e.g., phone, social media) during work hours.
5. **Review Your Schedule:** Ensure your tasks are aligned with your energy levels and peak productivity times.
6. **Reflect on Obstacles:** Identify whatÆs causing low productivity (e.g., stress, lack of clarity) and address it directly.

**Actionable Step for Tomorrow:**
Start with one small, high-priority task first thing in the morning to set a productive tone for the day. [/B_INST]
