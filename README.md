 🧠 How It Works

1. Data Generation: Synthetic productivity data is created and used to train a model.  
2. Model Prediction: FastAPI takes your inputs and predicts productivity category.  
3. AI Insight: The app calls OpenRouter’s Mistral model for personalized recommendations.  
4. Visualization: Results are plotted dynamically in trend and bar charts.  
5. Storage: Each record is saved in SQLite for weekly summaries and analysis.
